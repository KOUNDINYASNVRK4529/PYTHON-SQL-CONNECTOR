BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
I developed a Python-based banking management system that connects seamlessly to a MySQL database.
The program allows users to create and manage accounts, handle deposits and withdrawals, and track transactions.
It features strong input validation and error handling, giving users up to three chances to correct mistakes without crashing the program.
The system is built with modular functions for better readability and maintainability.
By combining Python’s flexibility with SQL’s robust data storage, it delivers a secure and user-friendly command-line banking experience.
